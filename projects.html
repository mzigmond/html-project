	<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Freshman Year </h2>

	<h4> Heads or Tails  </h4>
	<p style="font-family:serif;"> One of my first projects during freshman year was a simple et exciting Heads or Tails game, which sparked my intrest in coding.
	Although the game is not complicated, it was exciting to see something I created work. The code uses <code> random </code> library
	to "flip a coin" assigning either a 1 (Heads) or 0 (Tails). The game asks the user to guess the outcome and it keeps track of the
	number of correct and incorrect guesses and displays the score at the end. </p>


	<h4> Guess a Letter</h4>
	<p style="font-family:serif;"> This project builds upon the heads or tails game but instead of guessing heads or tails, you guess a letter of the alphabet.
	It tracks the number of attempts and displays the total guesses at the end of the game. Again, this is a vert simple project, it helped
	me understand loops and conditionals.  </p>   

	<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Sophmore Year </h2>

	<h4> Sorting algorithms</h4>
	<p style="font-family:serif;"> During my sophmore year, I worked on a project focused on understanding and implementing different sorting algorithms. 
	While this one was more complicted than just simple conditional statements, it was also a very valuable learning experience. 
	Learning about time complexity and making the algorithm as efficent as possible helped me learn and understand computational theory.</p>

	<h4> Joke API</h4>
	<p style="font-family:serif;"> For this project, I was able to learn how to use a web API to get a random joke and display it in two parts: the set up and the punch line.
	There is a brief pause before it displays the punchline. The code makes an HTTP request to the jokes API and uses <code> requests </code>
	library to print the set up and then it is followed by a 5-second delay using <code> time.sleep()</code> before it displays the punchline.
	</p>

	<h4> Random Coffee Picture API</h4>
	<p style="font-family:serif;"> This project intergrates with an API that displays a random picture of a cup of coffee. When the program is run, it triggers a 
	HTTP request to get a random coddee image and it automatically opens the image in a browser using <code> webbrowser </code>. This 
	was a fun way to expirment with APIs and understanding how they work.  </p>

	<h4>Snake</h4>
	<p style="font-family:serif;"> This is one of the projects I did outside of class. I followed along with Pythons offical guide to build the classic game of snake.
	I used pythons <code>pygame</code> library to create the game. That handled making the game board to play on, detecting collisions, 
	and updating the snakes position. I learned how to wokr with game mechanics like movement, scoring, and how to handle when the game 
	ends. </p>
