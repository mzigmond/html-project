	<h2> Heads or Tails  </h2>
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> One of my first projects during freshman year was a simple yet exciting Heads or Tails game, 
	which sparked my intrest. Although the game is not complicated, it was exciting to see something I created work. 
	The code uses <code> random </code> library  to "flip a coin" assigning either a 1 (Heads) or 0 (Tails).
	The game asks the user to guess the outcome and it keeps track of the  number of correct and incorrect 
	guesses and displays the score at the end. </p>
