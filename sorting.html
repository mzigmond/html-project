	<h2> Sorting algorithms</h2>
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> During my sophmore year, I worked on a project focused on understanding and 
	implementing different sorting algorithm. While this one was more complicted than just simple conditional statements, 
	it was also a very valuable learning experience. Learning about time complexity and making the algorithm as efficent as
	possible helped me learn and understand computational theory.</p>
