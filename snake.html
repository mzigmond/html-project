	<h2>Snake</h2>
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> This is one of the projects I did outside of class. I followed along with Pythons offical guide
	to build the classic game of snake. I used pythons <code>pygame</code> library to create the game.
	That handled making the game board to play on, detecting collisions, and updating the snakes position. 
	I learned how to wokr with game mechanics like movement, scoring, and how to handle when the game
        ends. </p>
