	<h1> My Coding Projects </h1>
	<p> Welcome to my portfolio showing the projects I've worked on during my coding journey
	 Although there are a few projects that I have workd on outside of class, most of these are from my class projects </p>
	<p> My biggest take aways so far are: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li> Your code will rarely work perfectly on the first try. Debugging is a part of the process</li> 
		<li> When it does not work, it is important to look at the probelm from a different angle </li>
		<li> Breaking down projects into smaller more manageable chunks is much more effective than doing it all at once</li>
		<li> There is always something new to learn in the world of coding </li>
	</ul>
